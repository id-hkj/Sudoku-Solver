# Sudoku-Solver

This Sudoku-Solver does what the name presents - it solves sudokus.
But it can do more than that. In version 3 onwards, it can check your progress in your own sudokus and see how many solutions it has!

In version 5, a sudoku generator may be introduced as we start exploring sudoku spin-offs to add in (ex. 6x6 grid, diagonal sudoku...).

Version 5 has just begun planning so it is still up in the air what I will aim for, but the spin-offs will probobly come in (the generator I'm not entirely sure about).

VERSION 5

-Incorporates Tkinter GUI

-Solves Sudokus

-Finds how many solutions a given sudoku may have

-The maximum number of solutions that will be checked can be changed

-Checks sudokus

-Input in Text (can use tab to move between boxes)

-If input board incorrectly, will specify all incorrect markings

-If input unsolveable board, will notify the user

-MAYBE Generate sudokus to solve

-PROBABLY Solve different sudoku spin offs

-UNLIKELY BUT POSSIBLE an update to the 'how many' algorithm to minimise the brute force search and give an acurrate number of solutions
