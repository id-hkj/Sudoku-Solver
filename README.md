# Sudoku-Solver

This Sudoku-Solver does what the name presents - it solves sudokus.
But it can do more than that. In version 3 onwards, it can check your progress in your own sudokus and see how many solutions it has!

VERSION 5 will:

-Incorporates Tkinter GUI

-Solves Sudokus

-Finds how many solutions a given sudoku may have

-The maximum number of solutions that will be checked can be changed

-Checks sudokus

-Input in Text (can use tab to move between boxes)

-If input board incorrectly, will specify all incorrect markings

-If input unsolveable board, will notify the user

-MAYBE Generate sudokus to solve IF V5 is made, this will be the only new feature. The others are not working out.
